# Preparation:
- **Statistical Techniques & ML:** Review your knowledge and experience with 
  GLM, predictive modeling, A/B testing, and dynamic pricing. Be prepared to 
  discuss specific projects where you've applied these techniques.

- **GLMS**: linear regression, logistic regression, poisson regression, 
  gasussian regression

- **A/B testing**: clear hypothesis, null hypothesis, control & treatment 
  groups randomisation

- **Dynamic Pricing**: a pricing strategy where the price of a product 
  or service fluctuates based on current market demand, supply 
  conditions, or other external factors. real-time data analysis; demand 
  forecasting; price elasticity; market conditions

- **Price elasticity of demand**: basically we want to understand what 
  effect on demanded 
  volumes will occur as a result of price change, and how those two 
  changes will affect gross profit. So we need to understand how demand 
  changes with price changes, cross elasticity of demand, income elasticity of demand, time horizon, 
  brand loyalty, 

- **Can you tell me about a time when you used statistical techniques or 
  machine learning to solve a business problem?**
   - Follow-up: What was the outcome and how did you measure success?
   - electricity demand forecasting; 
   - palm olein price forecasting
   - Kingston recovery project
   - Clough creditors 2nd meeting
   - Council claims project at Deloitte
   - Fraud case at Deloitte

2. **How have you applied predictive modelling in your previous roles?**
   - Follow-up: Can you provide specific examples, particularly in the context 
     of pricing or customer analytics?
   - predictive maintenance
   - forecasting palm oil price movements, for purchase planning, production 
     planning and pricing plans.

- **Describe a project where you had to present complex data insights to 
   senior leadership. How did you ensure your findings were understood and 
   actionable?**
   - Kingston recovery project; 
   - Clough creditors 2nd meeting; 
   - Project Nineveh at Deloitte

- **Cloud Technologies:** Familiarize yourself with Azure ML notebooks if you 
  haven't already. Understand how you can implement models in a cloud 
  environment.

### Questions About Your Experience and Skills

5. **How do you approach developing and maintaining analytical assets in a cloud environment?**
   - **Maintenance** involves several major components: VCS, Unit Testing, 
     CI/CD tools, project management tools, IaC, monitoring and logging, 
     data management and governance, security, cost management
   - I haven't used Azure Notebooks, but I have used Sagemaker, Kaggle 
     notebooks, jupyter notebooks, and Google Colab.

# Questions About Your Technical Proficiency
1. **Can you walk me through a project where you used Python or R for statistical analysis?**
   - Follow-up: What libraries or frameworks did you use, and why?
   - examples: electricity demand forecasting; 
   - palm olein price forecasting

2. **How proficient are you in SQL? Can you give an example of a complex query you have written?**
    - I'm proficient in SQL. I've written queries for data ETL.
    - Follow-up: How do you ensure your queries are optimized for 
      performance?
    - use proper indexing
    - optimise select statements
    - efficient join operations
    - avoid complexity
    - example: Clough 2nd creditors meeting

3. **What data visualisation tools have you used, and how do you decide which 
   one to use for a given task?**
   - PowerBI, Tableau, Python libraries. 
   - it depends on the client and use case. If its short term, i prefer PowerBI. If its long term I'd prefer to do it in 
     Python and embed in a website. Its cheaper and more efficient
   - Follow-up: Can you show or describe a visualization you are particularly proud of?
   - example: Clough Creditors 2nd meeting dashboard
   - energy demand forecasting

### Questions About Your Fit and Understanding of the Role
1. **Why are you interested in working at Domino’s, and what do you know about 
   our business model and market position?**
   - Domino's sees data science, analytics and machine learning as a core component of developing future value. Its not an "add on", where one's work might be unused or under valued
   - Domino's is innovative. when i come up with ideas i think I'll get the chance to test/prove them rather than being rejected out of hand
   - I want to work as part of a team, and i want to work with people who are better than me, so I can learn and improve
   - Based on what the recruiter has told me, there is a need for a person with good stakeholder management skills in Brisbane. Someone who can act as a bridge between the technical and non technical teams. I know that I can do a good job with that and I want to contribute

2. **How do you prioritise and manage multiple projects, especially when dealing with cross-functional teams?**
   - clearly identify milestones to success for success in each project, and the sub-tasks
   - clear understanding of individual responsibilities for each project
   - prioritise activities & allocate resources
   - regular project meetings to talk about progress vs plan, roadblocks, feedback, dynamic re-prioritisation
   - Use project management tools
   - Be quick to report bad news.

3. **Can you describe a situation where you had to engage and influence senior stakeholders? How did you ensure their buy-in?**
    - example 1: KK Kingston cash flow & solvency problem required me to engage with bankers, shareholders and the management team. successful
    - example 2: Clough Administration
    - example 3: Project Nineveh at Deloitte. had to engage with Partners and 
      Risk management team. Not successful

### Behavioral and Situational Questions
1. **Tell me about a time when you faced a significant challenge in your work. How did you overcome it?**
    - Post LNG construction, the PNG economy crashed and company 
      performance with it. 
    - It required me to engage all stakeholders and articulate a clear plan to recover the business.
    - I had to work with the management team to execute
    - I had to work with the board to get their buy-in
    - I had to work with the banks to obtain bridging finance
    - I always made a point of being fast qith bad news and always being truthful and forthcoming
   
2. **How do you keep up with the latest developments in data science and analytics? Can you give an example of how you’ve applied a new technique 
   or tool in your work?**
   - active community engagement, 
   - constant study and personal projects, 
   - competing on Kaggle, 
   - reading technical blogs and trying what they present for myself

3. **Describe a time when you had to work with a difficult team member or stakeholder. How did you handle the situation?**
   - first try to understand why that person is 'difficult', what's driving it.
   - from that, decide what actions i can take to resolve or minimise the issue
   - regular, open, honest, transparent communication.
   - Be prepared to hear tough things, don't take it personally

# 5. **Data Science and Machine Learning Questions**
Even though this is not a technical interview, understanding key concepts and being able to discuss them is important:

- **Explain complex models:**
  
  - **Neural Networks**: Neural networks are models inspired by the human brain that learn to make predictions by adjusting connections between layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) based on input data. They are made up of neurons, layers, weights & biases, forward propagation, backpropagation, activation functions, loss functions, optimisers
  - key components of NN are: data cleaning, transformation, the data loader, the model, loss function, optimiser, training loop, evaluation loop, device management
  - **Decision Trees**: make predictions by splitting data into branches based on feature values, leading to decisions at each node until a final outcome is reached. They are made up of structure, splitting, stopping criteria
  - **GBDT**: Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) are models that build an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, where each tree corrects the errors of the previous ones to improve prediction accuracy. They are made up of: initialisation, sequential learning, gradient descent, learning rate, regularisation 
  
- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Discuss how you evaluate the performance of your models (e.g., metrics used, cross-validation).
  
  - for **regression** problems: MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R^2
  
  - **time series** uses pretty much the same
  
  - for classification: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, log loss
  
  - For computer vision: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, IoU, mAP, pixel accuracy, mIoU, Dice Coefficient

  - for NLP: BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, CIDEr, SPICE, BERTScore, BLEURT, ROUGE-L, ROUGE-N, ROUGE-W, ROUGE-S
